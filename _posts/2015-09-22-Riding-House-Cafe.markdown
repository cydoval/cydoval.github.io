location: London
rating: 86
description: Definitely the most hyped Benedict in London that I ate at. Found it via some top 10 listicle for benedict in London. I wouldn't say it disappointed either. Overall a solid 86.

###Tell me about the ham baby!
Some very notable ham cuts on this puppy. Just look at those fat rings and the thick cut! It definitely powered this Benedict to it's high rating

###Hows the Bread?
Standard - nothing of note positive or negative. It did it's duty in the line of battle succintly.

###Give us the Egg!
Substandard! There was running white in my running yoke. That's a major detractor but it wasn't a game changer.

###Hollandaiser
Standard - expect for the fantastic garnish that really tied the dish together color wise. 

###Sides?
We are in England and along with all the other benedict I got in England, this one did not come with potatoes. 


###Anything else?
